The dataset provides insights into user behavior and engagement with a website, capturing various features such as daily time spent on the site, age, area income, daily internet usage, ad topic line, city, gender, country, timestamp, and whether the user clicked on an ad.

**Dataset Description**

Daily Time Spent on Site: The amount of time a user spends on the website (in minutes).

Age: The age of the user.

Area Income: The income of the area where the user resides.

Daily Internet Usage: The user's daily internet usage (in MB).

Ad Topic Line: The topic or content of the displayed ad.

City: The user's city of residence.

Male: A binary indicator for gender (1 for male, 0 for female).

Country: The user's country of residence.

Timestamp: The timestamp of the user interaction.

Clicked on Ad: A binary indicator (0 or 1) representing whether the user clicked on the ad (1) or not (0).

Potential Use Cases

User Behavior Analysis: Researchers can analyze this dataset to understand how different factors like age, daily internet usage, and area income correlate with ad engagement.

Ad Campaign Optimization: Marketers and advertisers can gain insights into which ad topics and demographics result in higher click-through rates (CTR).

Predictive Modeling: Data scientists can build predictive models to forecast the likelihood of a user clicking on an ad based on historical data.
